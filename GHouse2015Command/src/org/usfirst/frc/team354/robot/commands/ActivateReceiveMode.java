 * This mode raises the lift to a safe point and then lowers the shelf

 * 
 * This is a sequential action of raising (if necessary) the lift to an appropriate height
 * and then lowering the shelf to it's optimum position.
 * 
 * The lift only needs to be HIGHER than the safe point, so we pass false to ignoreLow 
 * (which makes sure that we move the lift out of the way), and true to ignoreHigh, which 
 * lets the lift stay if it's already past the safe point
